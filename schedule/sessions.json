    "description": "Pocket Science Lab is yet another ambitious project from FOSSASIA  with the objective to develop open source hardware and software technology to improve science education by changing the way we teach and learn. PSL@FOSSASIA   aims to deliver low-cost lab equipments to millions of students and young scientists and enable them to learn science by experimenting and exploring.  The main components of PSL are  ExpEYES: Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists [1] and MicroHope: Micro-controllers for Hobby Projects and Education [2] , projects by Dr. Ajith Kumar B P of IUAC, New Delhi [3].  ExpEYES is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments, classroom demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a portable science laboratory.   In this workshop participants will be able to do hands-on science experiments  covering various concepts like electricity, electromagnetic induction, sound, interference, oscillations etc...  This workshop is for kids of any age [10 to 100 years :) ] who are interested in science hacks :)  [1] ExpEYES: http://www.expeyes.in  [2] MicroHope:  http://www.microhope.org [3] IUAC:  http://iuac.res.in/ [4] PSL: http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/ ",

    "description": "With over one billion devices activated, Android is an exciting space to make apps to help you communicate, organize, educate, entertain or anything else you\u2019re passionate about.  Clearly there\u2019s a demand for Android app development, and it\u2019s turning the platform with the lovable green mascot into more and more of a strong first choice rather than just a secondary option.  So if you\u2019ve been intent on, thinking about, or simply playing with the idea of learning Android\u2026 Make Your First Android App is here for you!  The session aims at introducing budding developers with the basic concepts and terminology in Android Development. It shall begin from scratch and discuss how to setup the environment and build a very own personal Android App with a Splash Screen for starters.",
