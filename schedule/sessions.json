    "description": "Pocket Science Lab is yet another ambitious project from FOSSASIA  with the objective to develop open source hardware and software technology to improve science education by changing the way we teach and learn. PSL@FOSSASIA   aims to deliver low-cost lab equipments to millions of students and young scientists and enable them to learn science by experimenting and exploring.  The main components of PSL are  ExpEYES: Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists [1] and MicroHope: Micro-controllers for Hobby Projects and Education [2] , projects by Dr. Ajith Kumar B P of IUAC, New Delhi [3].  ExpEYES is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments, classroom demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a portable science laboratory.   In this workshop participants will be able to do hands-on science experiments  covering various concepts like electricity, electromagnetic induction, sound, interference, oscillations etc...  This workshop is for kids of any age [10 to 100 years :) ] who are interested in science hacks :)  [1] ExpEYES: http://www.expeyes.in  [2] MicroHope:  http://www.microhope.org [3] IUAC:  http://iuac.res.in/ [4] PSL: http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/ ",

    "description": "Last year at Burning Man 2015, we demonstrated an open hardware & software, 900 MHz radio-connected platform based on our Orchard IoT platform in the form of a conference badge. The badges bore a circular set of LEDs which would flash in a pattern unique to that badge. Attendees with other badges customized their light patterns by finding badges with patterns they like and \"having sex\" with them. The description of the light patterns is based on a diploid genome, and the process of breeding lights is modeled after the biological process of having sex. The overall protocol to exchange light genomes was designed to require explicit consent of both parties, thus layering a social experiment on top of a hardware experiment. By requiring explicit consent, the badges also served as an icebreaker and a seed for many fun conversations.",

    "description": "Anomaly detection is very important problem and extensive research has been done about it\u2019s various applications and domains. In this report I\u2019ve documented my research on anomaly detection in cloud computing architectures like OpenStack, Microsoft Azure & Amazon Web Services(AWS). Cloud computing systems create a big jungle of Logs and Metrics and these can provide a cloud operator tremendous insight into the systems and answer the most important questions about architecture\u2019s health. My research shows that cloud computing architectures face completely different types of anomalies than discussed in other domains and these metrics are not very useful if used in single dimension but if we perform anomaly detection on multiple dimensions together and correlate thus generated insights with Logs we can increase our efficiency and decrease false positive cases by a huge margin. When dealing with this amount of logs and metrics we need to come up with novel distributed architectures. In this research I\u2019ve focused on multiple dimensional anomaly detection on storm like distributed system using locality sensitive hashing and sequence mining. I hope that this research will provide us with a better understanding of different directions in which research and implementations have been done on the domain of anomaly detection, and how techniques which are proposed and implemented for a domain can be applied in different domains for which it was not initially intended to begin with.",

    "description": "FarmMind Technologies ==================== 1        PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------------------------------------------- This smart centralized system will help farmers to take a step into precision agriculture being monitored by wireless sensors in and around their farms. This covers problems like irrigation management, crop maintenance, soil fertility maintenance, crop yield improvement, pesticide management in compliance with good agricultural practices.  2        WORK FLOW  ---------------------------- The innovation focuses on developing a smart centralized system to control different requirements for a farm per crop being grown. An IoT based system integrates the cloud AI services with that of the hardware and sensors in the farms / fields which constantly stream real-time information to the servers. Depending on various other parameters like humidity, temperature and other meteorological data, predictions of the requirements of the farm is calculated and the hardware device which automatically opens the valves for irrigation / warns the farmer about doing a scheduled check in the localized language is made via SMS. This provides a centralized GIS collection of the soil data allowing extensive research and work by the agricultural scientists to guide the farmers in a given area for the crop they're growing. Simultaneously it provides the data for governments to optimize on the water irrigation routes / canals so that other drought struck areas can ensure water in times of need. The hardware solution consists of various sensors connected to the GSM chip module on board which allows the farmers to irrigate the farms when needed or transmit data to the required scientists/soil experts in the area who could help.  \u2022        It keeps updating the data base on parameters such as soil temperature, humidity, air temperature, determine frost and heat events, forecast harvest time. \u2022        It maps the fields from phone using GPS and input field sampling information.  \u2022        This systems aims for mobile first and cloud first implementation. \u2022        It integrates pest management system by observing, inspecting, and identifying certain trends in the pests and pesticides. It keeps the track record. \u2022        Last but not the least, it proposes high yielding plans and best crop management plans even under disasters.  3        FIELDS ARE THE NEW OFFICES AND DATA IS DRIVING THE TRACTORS  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are trying to use the emerging Cloud based technologies in AI, machine learning and big data to solve important problems as well as to get the problem notified to the related person in real time. This system allows farmers to monitor and maintain the quality of their farms by sitting at their home just using simple services like SMS in case there is no internet connectivity present in the area or by using the app built for android phones. The hardware is also sending data of the farm to the agricultural scientists who can use it to make data driven decisions. Integrations with the other meteorological information helps to offer the best advice for irrigation. This system can also be used to inform the farmers in a particular area in case of an agricultural outbreak risk in that area. The other solutions include animal breeding and maintaining the data informing the farmers about the required medication needed for the cattle. Mainly focuses on reliable, safety, interoperable, low cost implementation. ",

    "description": "Many problems of recent interest in the banks are detection of fraud analysis as well as insurance analysis that can be put in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of fea- tures or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable.  H2O makes it possible for anyone to easily apply math and predictive analytics to solve today\u2019s most challenging business problems. Combine the power of highly advanced algorithms, the freedom of open source, and the capacity of truly scalable in-memory processing for big data on one or many nodes. These capabilities make it faster, easier, and more cost effective to harness big data to maximum benefit for the business. Some Key features of using H2O are  Easy-to-use WebUI and Familiar Interfaces \u2013 Set up and get started quickly using either H2O\u2019s intuitive Web-based user interface or familiar programming environ- ments like R, Java, Scala, Python, JSON, and through our powerful APIs. Massively Scalable Big Data Analysis \u2013 Train a model on complete data sets, not just small samples, and iterate and develop models in real-time with H2O\u2019s rapid in-memory distributed parallel processing.

Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.  Can you imagine a world where phone communication works with all the benefits of email (but without spam)? Per-minute charges eliminated, flexibility for developers to customize the experience with standard scripting languages like Python or JavaScript and organizations of any size able to assert their identity and brand securely using SIP and XMPP addresses?  Is this a worthwhile vision? What do each of us - developers, sysadmins and end users - need to do to make it happen? What will be the alternative outcome - for both society in general and fans of free technology in particular - if we stand back and allow proprietary solutions to run rampant?  This session will survey some of the free software solutions that exist today and ways you can participate in their improvement and deployment to help realize this vision.",

    "description": "One common misconception about a lot of Open Source projects is that the quality is variable and/or is of a secondary concern. This is supported to a certain degree by a lot of projects which do minimal testing upstream and rely on downstream consumers, vendors, or distros to do an additional set of testing after a release. But, there is no reason that an open project can not also do QA in the open as part of the community.   While the term QA will likely evoke a combination of fear, disdain, or any of a plethora of negative emotions from anyone who has worked in a traditional enterprise development environment and probably scare them off. The top down approach, strict bureaucracy, and other issues which are often synonymous with QA teams doesn't have to be the case. There can be real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an open source project. It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to consumers the stability of a project. Larger projects can especially reap a lot of benefit from having people working on the QA side of a project upstream.  This talk will use OpenStack as an case study to explore how a large open source project can do QA in an open manner and the potential benefits it can provide. It'll cover how the OpenStack community does QA, how it's evolved over time, and share lessons of some best practices which have been learned over time.",
